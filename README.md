# Assignment_4
A prototype for our IMDM101 final project requiring us to create and design multiple scenes.

Task: Make a short story, create dynamic objects, and combine them into three scenes.

The basic premise of this experience is emotion through lose and regret. We'll be trying our best to depict that experience.
